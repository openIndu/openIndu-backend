# Datetime serialization
#

# datetime (we strip tzinfo before INSERT, see `utcnow()` in auth_service).
# When such a value is serialized via ``dt.isoformat()`` directly, the output
# has no timezone marker — e.g. ``2026-06-25T09:37:53.369247``. Browsers'
# ``new Date(...)`` then parses that as **local time**, which on a CST machine
# shifts every timestamp by ±8h.
#
# ``iso_utc(dt)`` is the single chokepoint that adds the ``+00:00`` marker so
# the wire format is unambiguous. The frontend then renders with
# ``new Date(s).toLocaleString('zh-CN', { timeZone: 'Asia/Shanghai', hour12: false })``.

# Real client IP resolution
#
# Behind one or more reverse proxies (K8s Ingress, nginx, an SLB), the TCP
# peer is the last proxy, not the user. Real IP travels in HTTP headers —
# *if* every hop is configured to set/append it. Header preference, in order:
#
#   1. ``X-Forwarded-For``  — historical standard. May be a comma-separated
#      chain like ``client, proxy1, proxy2``; the **leftmost public address**
#      is the client. We walk left→right and skip private/loopback hops so
#      a misbehaving inner proxy doesn't pollute the answer. Falls back to
#      the leftmost token if every entry is private (single-hop docker dev).
#   2. ``X-Real-IP``        — what nginx-ingress sets by default; many setups
#      have this and not XFF. Honoured as a fallback so we don't lose the
#      real IP just because the front door uses one convention over the other.
#   3. ``request.client.host`` — TCP peer. With Uvicorn's --proxy-headers,
#      this already reflects the parsed XFF when one is present, so this
#      branch is the last-resort path (containerised dev without a proxy).
#
# Returns ``None`` only if the request has no client at all (extremely rare
# in tests). Callers wanting a string sentinel should ``... or "unknown"``.
